Upstage, a leading AI startup in Korea, announced that its 'AskUp', a 'chatGPT with eyes', surpassed 100,000 friends on KakaoTalk channel in just one week since its launch.

Upstage announced on the 13th that it will extend the '100 Questions and Answers' event, which was originally scheduled to run until the 16th, to the end of March to celebrate the milestone of 100,000 friends on the AskUp channel. The '100 Questions and Answers' is an event in which users who have added the KakaoTalk AskUp channel can use 100 messages for free per day.

AskUp is a KakaoTalk artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Upstage based on OpenAI's chatGPT and its own OCR technology. It has been a hot topic since its launch on the 9th, recording 30,000 channel friends in just three days as a 'chatGPT with eyes' that can read, understand, and answer the contents of a document when the user takes a picture or sends it.

Since the launch of the '100 Questions and Answers' event, AskUp has been increasing at an average rate of more than 20,000 channel friends per day, ranking second in the KakaoTalk channel friend rapid rise rankings for four consecutive days, proving its hot heat. Considering that channels that hold events such as KakaoTalk emoji events usually rank first and second in the rapid rise rankings, AskUp has become the best channel on KakaoTalk, which grows only through word of mouth from users based on its convenient usability.

The number of posts on blogs and communities sharing the introduction and usage of AskUp also exceeded 200 as of the 12th, and public interest in 'chatGPT with eyes' AskUp is gradually increasing. Upstage plans to continue the '100 Questions and Answers' event for AskUp so that more people can access new AI technology and use the convenient chatGPT smoothly.

In addition, Upstage has applied an optimized process over the weekend to further increase the usability of users, improving the response speed of AskUp by more than two times and further improving the OCR recognition rate through UpOCR tuning. In addition, in preparation for the usage of more than 100,000 people, it has also consulted with OpenAI, the developer of chatGPT, to increase the daily usage limit of chatGPT and has taken preemptive measures to respond to traffic. Upstage plans to continue to make daily updates to improve the limitations of generative AI, such as hallucinations and inaccurate content due to the inability to reflect real-time information.

Upstage will go one step further in technology development for AskUp updates and share technology as an AI representative startup by disclosing prompt codes that implement the function. Upstage sympathizes with the flow of AI research that has developed based on the smooth sharing of information and has decided to share prompt engineering know-how in line with Upstage's mission of'making the world better with AI'. Among the prompt codes for additional functions in the future, the main codes will be disclosed through announcements on the main page of the Upstage website (https://www.upstage.ai/) in the future.

Kim Sung-hoon, CEO of Upstage, said, "I am very happy that AskUp is receiving a lot of love from 100,000 channel friends in just one week," and added, "We will do our best to understand the pros and cons of AI and use it well in everyday life by extending the '100 Questions and Answers' event that received a great response."
