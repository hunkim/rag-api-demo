AskUp, the 'eye-powered ChatGPT' developed by Upside, a leading AI startup in Korea, is innovating by finding real-time information as well, marking the 300,000th channel friend.

Upside announced on the 23rd that it will add the '? search' function to provide convenient AI search in conjunction with ChatGPT, marking the 300,000th channel friend of AskUp on KakaoTalk. AskUp incorporates a search engine and answers by finding the latest information, unlike ChatGPT, which has only learned information until 2021.

In addition, AskUp attaches a link to the source of the information it answers, supplementing the hallucination (hallucination) that provides inaccurate information by creating words, which is a limitation of ChatGPT, and innovating so that users can easily check the integrity of the information.

AskUp is a KakaoTalk artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Upside based on OpenAI's ChatGPT and combined with its own OCR technology. It is a 'ChatGPT with eyes' that can read, understand, and answer the contents of the document when the user takes a picture or sends a document. It is currently gaining popularity, surpassing 350,000 KakaoTalk friends in just 18 days since its launch. Users can use GPT-3.5 version 100 messages and GPT-4 version 10 messages for free by adding AskUp through KakaoTalk channel search.

With this update, AskUp users can enter the phrase '?' followed by the word they want to search for in the KakaoTalk channel chat window, and get an answer by summarizing the search results and checking the source right away. For example, by using '? search', you can enter the keyword you want to ask, such as '? upstage', '? askup', and '? blooming season this year', and get more accurate information by providing a summary of the search results and a link to the source, unlike the existing ChatGPT, which does not provide accurate answers to recent information after 2021 due to the nature of generative AI.

AskUp is receiving hot attention from the public, surpassing 350,000 channel friends on the 23rd, just 18 days after its launch. AskUp, which has applied GPT-4 and search functions, can utilize 27 languages, including Korean, and various fields of knowledge, and can answer not only English but also other languages such as Korean and Chinese. It is expected that its versatility will be further increased as it can provide information and process documents in various fields such as law, medical care, and education.

Kim Sung-hoon, CEO of Upside, said, "Following the application of GPT-4, we quickly updated AskUp to add a search function so that everyone can find and utilize the latest information more conveniently. It will bring about a revolution in mobile usage experience as it allows you to search right in the middle of a conversation." He added, "Upside aims to increase the accessibility and reliability of AI for the public through AskUp."

Upside is expanding the 'Backmun Baekdab' event, which provided 100 free messages every day to celebrate the application of GPT-4 on the 17th, and is providing an additional 10 GPT-4 utilization credits every day. If you put '!' in front of the message and talk, AskUp will answer using GPT-4. Considering that GPT-4 is 15 times more expensive than the existing ChatGPT, it has greatly increased user convenience.

Meanwhile, Upside introduced a service that can increase the efficiency and satisfaction of companies by optimizing it for the business environment by unveiling AskUp Biz, a business version of AskUp, for global users on the 20th. AskUp Biz consists of three parts: AskUp Doc, which can read various documents and obtain information through Chat AI, AskUp Web, which can provide information to visitors to the website through Chat AI, and AskUp Slack, which can be used in Slack, a business tool. It is receiving hot attention, receiving hundreds of demo applications on the day of its release.
