Upstage, which is drawing attention from the global AI industry for building the world’s best open LLM model, is expanding the domestic AI ecosystem through the joint construction of the Korean Open LLM leaderboard with NIA.

Upstage, a domestic AI startup, announced on the 5th that it has signed a "AI Hub Data Utilization Agreement" to build a Korean Open LLM leaderboard with the National Information Society Agency (NIA). The two companies held a signing ceremony at the NIA Seoul Office in Gwanghwamun, with key executives including Upstage CEO Kim Sung-hoon and NIA President Hwang Jong-sung in attendance.

Under this agreement, Upstage plans to build an "Open-Ko LLM Leaderboard" within this month to contribute to the development of the domestic AI industry ecosystem by utilizing various Korean data in various fields provided by AI Hub, NIA's artificial intelligence learning data platform.

The "Open-Ko LLM Leaderboard," a Korean version of the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard that evaluates open LLM models, is a platform that evaluates and ranks the performance of LLMs developed based on Korean language. It evaluates models based on four indicators: existing reasoning and common sense ability, language understanding comprehensive ability, and hallucination prevention, and additional criteria such as ethics and expert knowledge based on reliable data from NIA and academia.

Upstage ranked first in the Open LLM Leaderboard operated by Hugging Face in August, with its generative AI model showing world-class performance. Through this cooperation with NIA, Upstage plans to contribute to the ecosystem for the independence of domestic LLMs by developing high-quality LLMs that can capture Korean cultural sentiment based on data from AI Hub.

NIA has also joined Upstage's 1T Club through this cooperation and has promised to provide high-quality data. Upstage's 1T Club, which was launched last month, is collaborating with partners who contribute more than 100 million words of Korean data in various forms such as text, books, and articles, and is expanding the outer circle of the AI ecosystem for the development of artificial intelligence giant language models.

Upstage's 1T Club, which stands for "1 Trillion token club," allows partners to use the API of LLMs that Upstage produces at a discounted price, and they can share the profits generated by the API business of LLMs. Upstage plans to use the data provided by partners only for the purpose of training models and will make every effort to ensure security and personal information protection so that the original text cannot be extracted. 

Upstage CEO Kim Sung-hoon said, "Through the agreement with NIA, we have been able to solve the problem of lack of Korean data and provide a competitive artificial intelligence platform in the domestic and foreign markets." He added, "We will prove the performance and innovation of domestic LLMs through the Korean Open LLM leaderboard with NIA and make efforts to develop and promote artificial intelligence."

NIA collects and processes various data through AI Hub and provides it free of charge to artificial intelligence developers. NIA plans to build 1,300 types of data by 2025, and through this, it will contribute to the growth and activation of the domestic artificial intelligence industry.

NIA President Hwang Jong-sung said, "Through the agreement with Upstage, an AI startup that is recognized globally, the data of AI Hub can be used in the domestic and foreign artificial intelligence markets." He added, "We will increase the level and diversity of domestic LLMs through the Korean Open LLM leaderboard and make more efforts to build an artificial intelligence ecosystem."
