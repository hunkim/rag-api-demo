AI startup Upstage's Chat AI 'AskUp' is celebrating the milestone of reaching 500,000 subscribers on KakaoTalk channel friends, and increasing user benefits through various events.

Upstage announced on the 30th that it will extend the 100-message-a-day event for a month, and expand the opportunity for users to use AskUp through the 'AskUp Challenge' event on SNS, ahead of the 500,000 subscribers on KakaoTalk AskUp channel friends.

AskUp is a domestic representative Chat AI developed by Upstage based on OpenAI's ChatGPT, combined with its own OCR technology and? (question mark) search. It is famous as a 'ChatGPT with eyes' that can read and answer questions when users take a picture of a document, and is expected to surpass 500,000 on the 31st. It is gaining attention as an innovative service that provides the latest information and accurate answers by applying GPT-4 and adding a search function that goes one step further from ChatGPT, and is also receiving great attention for 'AskUp Biz', which targets corporate customers.

Upstage will extend the '100-message-a-day' event, which provided free 100 messages every day, for a month until the end of April for 500,000 users of AskUp. Upstage also added 10 GPT-4 utilization credits every day on the 17th to celebrate the application of GPT-4. As a result, all users who have added the AskUp channel until the end of April can continue to enjoy the free benefits of 100 GPT-3.5 messages and 10 GPT-4 messages.

In addition, Upstage will hold a user appreciation event and hold the 'AskUp Challenge' for three weeks from March 30 to April 21, which can be easily entered on various SNS channels such as Instagram, Facebook, and blogs.

The 'AskUp Challenge' is an event where anyone can receive credit gifts just by taking a certification photo and showing it to AskUp. The participation method is simple. Just share it on your own SNS with three hashtags, such as #AskUp #AskUp #AskUpChallenge, and send it to AskUp.

For example, if you take a picture of the washing method written in a foreign language and ask AskUp, or share a scene where you searched for the same singer's song using the cover photo of your favorite music album, you can automatically participate by attaching tags and sending it to AskUp.
All users who complete the AskUp Challenge can receive an additional 100 free message credits on a first-come, first-served basis. In addition, a 'Golden Ticket' event will be held to draw 10 people every day and give away 1,000 credits. You can check whether you have won the Golden Ticket by typing 'GoldenTicketCheck!' in AskUp.

It is expected that various cases will be shared through this challenge, taking advantage of the characteristics of AskUp, which can recognize and analyze text in documents and images, search for the latest information, and provide various information and conversations suitable for users' tastes and interests.

Meanwhile, Upstage is also conducting a'survey event' to listen to the voices of users to improve the AskUp service. AskUp users can receive additional event credits of 100 by filling out the survey announced on the KakaoTalk 'AskUp' channel and taking a screenshot of the certification code and sending it to AskUp.

Upstage CEO Kim Sung-hoon said, "We have extended the free event to celebrate the milestone of 500,000 subscribers for AskUp, so that users can use AskUp more freely and conveniently." He added, "We are holding the 'AskUp Challenge' to widely promote the fun and useful ways to use AskUp, so we ask for a lot of participation and interest."
